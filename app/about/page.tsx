            <p>Hey there! I'm Alex Joines, the founder and sole operator of Driveway Detailing. As a recent graduate from Tennessee Tech and a full-time software developer, I've turned my long-standing passion for car care into a thriving side hustle. My journey with auto detailing began years ago when I started meticulously cleaning and maintaining my own vehicles, constantly refining my techniques and exploring the best products in the industry.</p>

My background in software development has instilled in me a keen eye for detail and a problem-solving mindset, which I apply to every detailing project.</p>
